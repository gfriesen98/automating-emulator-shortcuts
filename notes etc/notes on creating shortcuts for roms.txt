we can use powershell to create shortcuts for launching roms for emulators

it should be ensured that emulators should be installed portably for it to make sense to automate

the emulator should also be able to be launched with command arguments, obviously

for duckstation:
1. extract emulator to a folder
2. put games in a 'games' folder in the emulator folder
3. put bios in a 'bios' folder in the emulator folder
4. create "portable.txt" in duckstation root or launch the exe with "-portable" to force portable
launching duckstation should create its folders and recognize the bios we added already

multidisk games should be single duckstation instances with both isos/cues in the games folder, seperate shortcuts can be added by editing the createShortcut script to make 2 shortcuts for each disk. then the saves folder can be shared

further reference the "createShortcut.ps1" script, it would need to be edited per game

icons should be 256x256, windows recognizes this as the max size and will downscale as needed

todo for duckstation:
- how to create -resume shortcut, if no savestate exists it wont launch ??
- create configurable settings file to create, allow upscaling etc (.\duckstation\settings.ini)
	- need to ensure this doesnt get overwritten, when duckstation launches in portable mode it generates these files/folders
